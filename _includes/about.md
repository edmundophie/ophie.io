Hi there!  
My name is **Edmund Ophie**.  
And you can call me *Edmund*.  
I am a software engineer and I'm currently working in Jakarta, Indonesia.  

In the past, I've been working in Bandung and Singapore. 
And from my experience, I found Singapore as one of the greatest place to live in.  I really hope someday I could get back to the country to work again, with a better job ofcourse lol.      

Professionally, I've done some frontend projects in the past, especially mingling with `vue.js` quite a lot, but my jobs have been mostly spent in the backend side, working with `c#` and `java` stack.  Lately, I've been trying to relearn and deepen my frontend knowledge, especially in `react` and `css`.  

Back then when I was still in college, I loved to climb mountains. The highest mountain I've climbed is *Mount Semeru*, which is the highest mountain in Java and also the third highest in Indonesia, located 3600++ meters above the sea level.

Nowadays, I love to explore stuff around the web development technology in my free time. Currently, I'm trying to make it a habit to put what I've learned into writing in this blog. In the future, I expect that I could fill up this blog more with software engineer material. Occasionally, I also like to spill my random thought in here.
