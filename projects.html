    <p>Hi there!<br />
My name is <strong>Edmund Ophie</strong>.<br />
And you can call me <em>Edmund</em>.<br />
I am a software engineer and I’m currently working in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve been working in Bandung and Singapore. 
And from my experience, I found Singapore as one of the greatest place to live in.  I really hope someday I could get back to the country to work again, with a better job ofcourse lol.</p>

<p>Professionally, I’ve done some frontend projects in the past, especially mingling with <code class="highlighter-rouge">vue.js</code> quite a lot, but my jobs have been mostly spent in the backend side, working with <code class="highlighter-rouge">c#</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">java</code> stack.  Lately, I’ve been trying to relearn and deepen my frontend knowledge, especially in <code class="highlighter-rouge">react</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">css</code>.</p>

<p>Back then when I was still in college, I loved to climb mountains. The highest mountain I’ve climbed is <em>Mount Semeru</em>, which is the highest mountain in Java and also the third highest in Indonesia, located 3600++ meters above the sea level.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/semeru.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center"><small>Me with the background of sunrise at the summit of Mt. Semeru</small></div>

<p>Nowadays, I love to explore stuff around the web development technology in my free time. Currently, I’m trying to make it a habit to put what I’ve learned into writing in this blog. In the future, I expect that I could fill up this blog more with software engineer material. Occasionally, I also like to spill my random thought in here.</p>

<p>If you need to reach me, please feel free to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ping</code> me at <a href="mailto:edmund@ophie.io">edmund@ophie.io</a></p>
