I've been thinking of putting what I've read daily into a blog post. My motivation is that I hope it can help me to internalize what I've read so they doesn't go in vain.And also, I think it can be very useful in the future for when I forget or need it or maybe when I want to review my past reading materials. 

I'm gonna name the series as **TLDR** (Too Long Doesn't Read), as I try my best to put the summary of the reads into bullet points. I also believe that way would be easier for readers to digest the content. 

In the end, through this blog series I hope you can get something without you needing to spend time readomg the whole lengthy original articles.
