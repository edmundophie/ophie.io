# Original Article
* [Less Known Coding Fonts](#https://vfoley.xyz/lesser-known-coding-fonts/)

# TLDR
* [Hack](#https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) is the most popular font at [/r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn)
* The less known coding fonts are:
  * [APL385 Unicode](#http://apl385.com/fonts/)
  * [Go Mono](#https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts)
  * [Sudo](#https://www.kutilek.de/sudo-font/)
  * [Monoid](#https://larsenwork.com/monoid/)
  * [Input Mono](#https://input.fontbureau.com/)

# My 2 cents
* Looking those fonts, I can't decide which one is the best for me.
  * Since I'm not that nitpick about fonts, all of them **look alike** to me.
* Reading through HN comments, [**Pragmata Pro**](#https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) is the most popular paid font.
  * The license price quite expensive, **â‚¬199**
* As for the free one, [**Iosevka**](#https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) seems to be the winner.
* Me personally have been trying out Iosevka for these past few weeks..
