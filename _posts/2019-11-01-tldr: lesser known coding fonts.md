## My Comments
* Looking those fonts, I can't decide which one is the best for me.
  * Since I'm not that nitpick about fonts, all of them **look alike** to me.
* Reading through HN comments, [**Pragmata Pro**](#https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) is the most popular paid font.
  * The license price is quite expensive tho, **â‚¬199**
* As for the free one, [**Iosevka**](#https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) seems to be the winner.
* Me personally has been trying out `Iosevka` for these past few weeks..
  * My impression so far: **I enjoy it**.
  * It makes my terminal looks **more spacious**
